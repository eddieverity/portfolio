                <p class="text-faded">Looking for a Web Developer role that is challenging, has room for growth, and fosters creativity and innovation.<br><br>
                    I’m a recent graduate of a 1000+ hour bootcamp specializing in full-stack web development.<br><br>
                    My journey to coding started when i was working at a startup in Shanghai doing data analysis working with developers on a project, and how much i wanted to be involved in development process. To the point where I realized I wanted to develop things myself. <br><br>
                    With the experiences i’ve gained working in adventurous & exciting environments, as well as the acquired toolbox of programming, I am ecstatic to hit the ground running in a career of web development!
